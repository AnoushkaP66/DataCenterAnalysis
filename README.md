# Java-Based Projects
Projects that i have worked on between August 2024-May 2025 focusing on the fundamentals of object oriented programming.

In Fall 2024, I have demonstrated my understanding in the fundamentals of the Java programming language by analyzing various metrics and parameters of data centers and simulated them using JUnit testing, given by my instructor.

In Spring 2025, I took my knowledge of Java to a new level by demonstrating basic understanding of various algorithms and data structures and implementing them in various scenarios.
